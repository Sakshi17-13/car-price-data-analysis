# Car Price Data Analysis

This project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
on a car price dataset. All implementations are done independently.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** (`01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`)
   - Handling missing values
   - Correcting data formats
   - Standardization and normalization
   - Feature binning

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (`02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`)
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
   - Insights and trends derived from the dataset

## Dataset
- The project uses the IBM Car Price dataset, which has been **cleaned and preprocessed independently** for this project.
- Dataset is included in the `data/` folder as `car_price_cleaned.csv`.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Learning Source
- Concepts practiced independently after learning from **IBM Cognitive.ai (Skills Network)**.
